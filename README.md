**ASP.NET MVC DEPI 
The Pharmacy System Project aims to simplify and secure the online purchasing process, 
providing users with a reliable platform to access essential medications without visiting a 
pharmacy. By leveraging a structured software development approach, this project enhances the 
functionality of online medicine browsing, secure payment processing, and comprehensive 
inventory management for pharmacy administrators. The system is designed to accommodate 
user and admin roles, ensuring efficient management of orders, medicine categories, and user 
accounts while prioritizing data security, scalability, and ease of use for all stakeholders.
